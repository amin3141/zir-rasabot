Each property keeps detailed records of all 'found' items and will store these for a maximum of three months. After this period, in line with the directives of the General Department of Criminal Investigation in Dubai, all unclaimed items will be handed over to the nearest Police Station. These 'found' items will then be kept at the police warehouse for a further three months after which they will be auctioned, and any funds raised given to charity.Should hotel guests need to locate any item after the initial three month period expires, they are requested to contact the hotel who will assist in coordinating with the police station where the found items are handed over. The police will then advise the necessary procedures to locate any item."
