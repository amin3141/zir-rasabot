# How-to

First you need to have the rasa shell installed. You can do that by following the rasa tutorials https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation

Next is training the model

```
rasa train
```

Then to run in one terminal you need to run 

```
rasa run --credentials ./credentials.yml  --enable-api --auth-token XYZ123 --model ./models --endpoints ./endpoints.yml --cors "*"
```

And in the background or in another terminal run

```
rasa run actions
```

Lastly, to view the bot in the UI either simply load the `www/index.html` file in the browser or run `python3 server.py` and open `localhost:8080` in browser.

You could also just run the two commands and talk with the bot in shell

```
rasa run actions &
rasa shell
```
